// @platform/contracts/wire — the over-the-wire contract.
//
// Everything exported from here is language-agnostic in spirit: zod schemas
// describing request/response payloads, error codes, pagination shapes, and
// query parameters that any API implementation (Hono, FastAPI, .NET, etc.)
// must honor. Generators (e.g. PR 1.2 OpenAPI emitter) read this barrel
// exclusively. Do NOT import TS-only ergonomics (route URL builders, form
// helpers, branded types) from here — those live in `@platform/contracts/ts`.
