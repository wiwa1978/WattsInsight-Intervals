/**
 * PR 1.1 — `@platform/contracts` is split into two subpath exports:
 *   - `/wire` : zod schemas, error codes, payload shapes (the cross-language
 *     contract — what a FastAPI/.NET reimplementation must honor)
 *   - `/ts`   : TS-only ergonomics (route URL builders, form helpers)
 *
 * The legacy aggregate `@platform/contracts` re-exports both for
 * backwards compatibility while consumers are migrated. These tests pin
 * the boundary so future PRs can't accidentally leak TS helpers into the
 * wire surface (which would silently break the OpenAPI generator added in
 * PR 1.2).
